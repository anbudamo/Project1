# AND101 Project 1 - Hello, Squirrel!

Submitted by: Anbu Damodaran

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Summary

Hello Squirrel is an android app that recreates the common "Hello, World!", to introduce ourselves to the neighborhood squirrel üêø.  It includes UI elements such as an ImageView and textfield that builds the user profile.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: ü§† üèÖ ü§ë
